## Playing the memory game

This is the classic game of memory.

Click any card and you will see what that card is.

Match any two cards and those two cards will stay face up.

If the two cards do not match then they will turn face down and you can try two more cards.

The object of the game is to find each of the cards match in as few moves as possible.

The more moves it takes you, the more stars you will lose.

Try and find all of the matches as fast as possible.  Your time will be displayed at the end of the game.

Click the cancel  button to remove the summary screen. Click the replay button to re-shuffle the cards and start over.

Start over any time by clicking the replay icon at the top right hand corner of the game.
